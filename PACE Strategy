# **PACE Strategy for the Project**

## **Plan**

### **Objectives:**

- Understand the soil properties affecting crop productivity in Chiquiza, Boyacá.
- Develop actionable recommendations for optimal agricultural practices based on data insights.
- Implement a Decision Trees algorithm to predict crop productivity based on soil properties.

### **Key Questions:**

- Which soil properties significantly influence crop productivity in Chiquiza, Boyacá?
- What are the optimal ranges of soil properties for different crops to thrive?
- Can we accurately predict crop productivity based on soil properties using a Decision Trees algorithm?

## **Analyze**

### **Data:**

A fictional dataset based on real data from real soil studies implemented in a government projectis created to prove the algorithms
The following soil properties will take into account:

- Soil pH
- Organic Matter
- Nitrogen Content
- Phosphorus Content
- Potassium Content
- Soil Moisture
- Soil Temperature
- Crop Productivity (target variable)

### **Database Schema:**

Table: SoilProperties
- soil_id (Primary Key)
- soil_ph (float)
- organic_matter (float)
- nitrogen_content (float)
- phosphorus_content (float)
- potassium_content (float)
- soil_moisture (float)
- soil_temperature (float)
- crop_productivity (float)

### **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):**

- Summary statistics for each soil property.
- Distribution plots for soil properties.
- Correlation matrix to identify relationships between soil properties and crop productivity.


## **Construct**

Algorithm: Decision Trees
We'll use the scikit-learn Python library to implement the Decision Trees algorithm for predicting crop productivity based on soil properties.
Train the Decision Trees algorithm using the dataset.
Evaluate the model and fine-tune hyperparameters if needed.

## **Execute**

Generate recommendations for optimal agricultural practices based on the model.
